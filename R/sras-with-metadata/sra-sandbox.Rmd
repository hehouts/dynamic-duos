```{r}

```

The biosample_result.txt file I can download from the sra website. it doesnt have any join-able data. none. 
```{bash}
#ls
head -n 45 biosample_result.txt
```

so made a conda env `sratoolkit`, and did `conda install sra-tools` per [this](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/sra-tools/README.html)
